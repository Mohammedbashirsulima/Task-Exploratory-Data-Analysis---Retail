Task: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

I completed Task #3 of my Data science and business analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation in JANUARY 2024. As part of the graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP)

To conduct the analysis as described, we'll first need to explore and analyze the data related to Sample Superstore to gain insights into different states, Segments, and predictions. The steps we'll follow are as follows:



Understand the Problem:



We'll review the dataset and understand the variables it contains, such as 'Ship Mode,' 'Segment,' 'Country,' 'City,' ,'Prices','Region','Category',etc. We'll analyze the relevance and significance of each variable for the problem at hand, which is likely related to pricing, Sales, and Location.

We'll explore how the 'Profit' variable is related to other independent variables like 'City,' 'Category,' 'Sub Category,' etc. This analysis can involve Bar chart other visualization techniques to identify potential patterns or relationships.



Basic Cleaning:

I handled missing data and convert categorical variables into numerical format (if required). Cleaning the dataset is crucial to ensure the accuracy of our analysis.



Test Assumptions:

Based on the analysis, we'll draw key understandings about different Profit and Loss on different States and city on USA . We'll identify factors that contribute to higher demand for certain Subcategory , and how price, location, and Sales influence each other.



Technologies used for this project include Excel, Power BI, Microsoft Clipchamp for screen recoding was the software used for development.
